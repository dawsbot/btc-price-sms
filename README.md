Want the current Bitcoin price via SMS?

Using this code and Twilio, you can access data derived from the blockchain
without needing internet access! Full tutorial available [on my blog](http://bit.ly/1JaJDJA).

* Node.js app
* Coinbase API
* Twilio used for SMS

If you would like to see a more elaborate example using Bitfinex's API, check out that branch also in this repo.
