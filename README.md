[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Deploy this to Heroku and then connect it to Twilio. You can get Bitcoin prices
**without internet access!** 

Makes use of:

* Coinbase API
* Twilio used for SMS

If you would like to see a more elaborate example using Bitfinex's API, check out that branch also in this repo.
